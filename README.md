# The Market
A Fullstack MERN app for online marketplace.
Demo: https://the-market-beryl.vercel.app/


To run the app locally run this command from the-market/ directory:
```js
npm run dev
```
which starts expressjs server and vite dev server using concurrently package.


## todo
Current features:
- login/register
- browse listings including categories or user specific
- add listings (no images atm, need to figure a way for this, because apparently you shouldn't store images in mongodb idk)
- buy listings (no payment or anything, listings just disappear with a notification that you bought it for now)
- listings are being removed when they expire
  

Plan on doing:
- add more content
- work on ui/ux
- maybe add some kind of payment system like stripe
- add listing images
